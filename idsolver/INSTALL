Installation
------------

- Install Form

- Install Fermat. Make sure that it can be called globaly in the system as
  'ferl'.

- Install qdbm-1.8.77 (there, go also into plus directory and install the
  content to the same qdbm-1.8.77 destination) 

- Compile DiaGen  Utilities IdSolver  IdSolver/Tools

- Add paths to .bashrc

    PATH=$PATH:$HOME/heptools/fermat
    
    PATH=$PATH:/heptools/qdbm-1.8.77/bin
    export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$HOME/heptools/qdbm-1.8.77/include
    export LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/heptools/qdbm-1.8.77/lib
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/heptools/qdbm-1.8.77/lib
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/work/ttbar/scripts
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/work/ttbar/idsolver/IdSolver/Tools


Possible issues:
----------------

 - If generate_identities does not progress it may be because ferl is not
   accesile through PATH.

 - It all works with 32-bit version of fermat 3.9.9999. Version 6.17 in
   conjuction with IdSolver produces an error. There must be some compatibility
   issues that could be solved in principle in the future.

 - 32-bit ferl cannot be used on 64-bit system unless gcc-multilib is installed.

 - If the test program

      $../IdSolver/Tools/solve_prototypes proto 1 1 ep

    gets stuck at "Creating administrative and identity files...", it means that
    ferl cannot be loaded so check the PATH.

 - If generate_identities does not progress, it may be because of ferl, which
   does not work due to missing glibc.i686 (on SLC6).
