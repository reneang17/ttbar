Utilitites for difference equation determination according to the
Laporta algorithm. In order for them to work, one should:

1) use prototypes,which have the last line with mass X, this mass
   will be replaced by 1, and the symbolic power x will be assigned to
   the line. if the output integral has power n on the last line, then
   the real power is x+n.

2) set the option IntegralMap::LaportaOrdering

3) set the option PrototypeMap::SolveX, if one doesn't want the prototypes
   without the X line to be solved. this is a useful speedup

It is also better to first construct the system of identities with
PrototypeMap::StoreIdentities, and only then solve for the crucial identities,
since in practice one just needs a few integrals.
