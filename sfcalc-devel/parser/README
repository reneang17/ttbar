[dirs+]             - directories to be processed 

[withredundant]     - generate files for the reundant integrals (i.e. the ones
		      which do not takie into account symmetires of 2-cut
                      graphs; with 0, 54 files are generated, without, 83

[combine]           - combine functions from different sectors into a single
		      function; 1, speeds up compilation and reduces the number
                      of integrals, 0, allows one to compute individual graphs 
                      later on, which is useful to resolve the problem of infs

[poles]            -  decide which poles to compute, all, means all

[precision]        -  either 64 (double precision) or 128 (quadruple precision)
