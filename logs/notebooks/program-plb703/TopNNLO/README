  1 and 2 in the name denote to the order of the hard function. The last two
  indices correspond to colour space, hence 2 in qq and 3 in gg. The first index
  corresponds to the power of Log[hscale^2/mt^2] according to: 
  Hqq1 = Lmu2m2**2 * Hqq1_coeff(2,:,:) + Lmu2m2 * Hqq1_coeff(1,:,:) + Hqq1_coeff(0,:,:)

  Arrays: real(8) :: Sqq1(0:2,2,2), Sqq2(1:4,2,2) 

  1 and 2 denote the order of the soft function. The last two indices correspond
  to colours space. The first index seems to match that of the hard functions but
  in practices, all soft functions with different values of the first index are
  indentical.

  Top quark pair production in approximated NNLO QCD
  
  Based on the following papers:

The program needs several external libraries:

 LHAPDF(libLHAPDF.a): http://projects.hepforge.org/lhapdf/
 Cuba(libcuba.a): http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/

If these libraries are installed in a non-standard location, it can be specified in the
first line of "makefile". (Note: The program is by default assumed to be linked with Cuba
version 2.x. To use Cuba version 1.x, change Cuba_VERSION to 1 in the second line of
"makefile".)


Also note that the program relies on the script "lhapdf-config" in LHAPDF to determine the
directory containing the PDF sets. Make sure that "lhapdf-config" is in the PATH and the
PDF sets are put in the directory returned by executing "lhapdf-config --pdfsets-path".


The program is tested under Scientific Linux 5.4 with gfortran 4.1.2 and under Mac OS X
10.6 with gfortran 4.2.3.


To use the program, type "make" to compile it, and run the driver script

  ./RunTop.py sqrtS scheme mt [pdfset]

where

      sqrtS: center-of-mass energy of the collider (1960 for Tevatron, others for LHC)
     scheme: 0 for pole scheme, 1 for MSbar scheme, 2 for 1S scheme
         mt: the top quark mass in the specified scheme
   [pdfset]: MSTW for MSTW2008NNLO (default), NNPDF for NNPDF2.1, CTEQ for
             CTEQ6.6, CT10 for CT10

The program will print out the cross section with perturbative uncertainties and
PDF+alphas uncertainties.

There is another driver script RunTop2.py with more functionalities. Run it without
parameters to see the usage.
