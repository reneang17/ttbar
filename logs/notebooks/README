To produce the .hh and .cc files, which built the topqT++ program, one needs to
run:

   $ math -run -noprompt < GenerateCppCodeHardFunction.m
   (this will generate hard.hh, hardqq.cc, hardgg.cc)
    

   $ math -run -noprompt < GenerateCppCodeSoftFunction.m
   (this will generate soft.hh, soft.cc)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Three types of files:

  Name.m

    These files contain basic building blocks used to construct the final
    program. They are either copied from existing literature or calculated in
    the CalculateName.m modules. Or both.

  CheckName.m

    Here I perform checks of quantities from Name.m. These include both
    comparisons to literature and internal consistency checks. Once in a while,
    one should run all these files.

  CalculateName.m

    Here I calculate quantities and the result is saved in a separate module,
    which then can be used by the final Mathematica program.
